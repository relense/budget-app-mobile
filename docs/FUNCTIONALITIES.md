# Functionalities — What The App Can Do Right Now

Plain-language walkthrough of the app from the user's perspective, as built
today. Not a design-rationale doc (see `PLAN.md` for that) and not the API
reference (see `SERVICES.md` for that) — just "what can I actually do."

## 1. Sign up / log in

- Enter email → get a 6-character code by email → enter code → logged in.
- First time ever: this also creates the account and seeds a default set of
  starter categories for free.
- Returning: same code flow, just logs in.

## 2. Categories

The spending buckets — "Housing", "Shopping", "Health", etc.

- Create a category (name, expense or income, and if expense, need/want/savings).
- Edit or delete a category (delete only works if it's never been used in
  any month).
- Categories sit in a catalog and don't belong to any month by themselves —
  they can sit unused/dormant until activated for a month.

## 3. Months

- No explicit "create a month" action — the app figures out the "current
  month" on its own (earliest one that isn't locked yet, or today's real
  month if brand new).
- "Activate" a category *for* a month by adding it with a budget amount
  (e.g. "Housing: 900€ this month") — manual, per category, per month.
- Locking a month freezes everything in it forever — no more edits, no more
  transactions.
- Can pre-provision the *next* month early (one month ahead, not further).
- A pre-provisioned month with nothing in it yet can be deleted.

## 4. Transactions

Actual spending/income entries.

- Log a transaction against an active category-for-a-month: amount, date,
  optional merchant/note.
- Edit or delete it (only if that month isn't locked).

## 5. Recurring expenses ("Contas" — Rent, Netflix, etc.)

One flat row per recurring expense per month it exists in — name, category,
amount, due day, and paid-or-not (via a linked transaction). No separate
"template" — that split was tried, then dropped (see `PLAN.md`'s Data Model
section for the reasoning).

- Create one directly, for a given month: also auto-activates its category
  for that month if needed, same "no dormant state" rule categories don't
  get.
- Moving to a new month **automatically** copies the previous month's list
  forward (fresh, unpaid) — no per-item opt-in, and no link between one
  month's row and the next month's copy (each is fully independent).
  Whichever action first touches a brand-new month — adding a category or
  creating a new recurring expense — triggers this, not just locking.
- Mark one paid → creates a transaction linked to it. Callable more than
  once for split payments (e.g. rent paid in two chunks); tracks whether
  the total paid covers the full amount.
- Edit one directly (name/category/budget type/due day/amount, all
  together) — only ever changes that one month's row. No "apply to future
  months too?" question, since there's no template default to reconcile
  against.
- Remove one from a month (blocked if a transaction already points at it).
  The same name can't exist twice in the same month, but can repeat across
  different months (e.g. "Rent" every month).

## 6. Savings funds

Named savings goals, separate from monthly spending categories (e.g.
"Emergency Fund", "Wedding") — money that accumulates over time rather than
resetting each month.

- Create a fund: name, starting balance, optionally a target amount, a
  start/end date, and a monthly savings target.
- Log a deposit or withdrawal against it (a "movement") — a withdrawal is
  blocked if it would leave the fund negative, even under concurrent
  requests.
- Edit or delete a movement — the balance is re-checked against the edit or
  removal the same way, so you can never end up negative by editing history
  either.
- Delete a fund (only once it has no movements left).
- See the fund's current balance and whether it's hit its target — both
  calculated live from its movements, not stored numbers that could drift.

## 7. Income

There's no separate "income source" feature — income is just a category
like any other, tagged as income instead of expense (e.g. "Salary",
"Freelance"). Add it to a month like any category, with the expected amount
as its budget; each paycheck you log is a normal transaction against it.

- Every category-for-a-month now also shows how much has actually come in
  (or, for expense categories, actually been spent) — the "actual" number
  next to the planned one, calculated live from its transactions.
- Ask for just the income side (or just the expense side) of a month
  separately, e.g. for a dedicated "Income this month" view.

## 8. Bank balance

A single running total of your money, separate from any one month and
separate from Savings Funds (moving money into a fund doesn't change this
number — it's still yours, just tracked in two places, same as keeping a
spreadsheet column for "in the bank" and another for "invested").

- Tell the app how much you have right now (e.g. "I have 30k") — it doesn't
  matter when in the month you do this, or whether you've used the app
  before. If you don't set anything, it just assumes 0 to start.
- From that point on, the balance updates automatically as you log income
  and expense transactions — no need to touch it again unless the real
  number needs correcting (e.g. you double-checked your actual bank
  balance and want to reset the anchor).
- Correcting it doesn't rewrite history — it just means "start counting
  from here," so old transactions logged before the correction stop
  affecting the number.
- Unlike everywhere else in the app, this number is allowed to go negative
  — a real bank account can be overdrawn.
